I have always enjoyed making things. I'm passionate about working on things that help others. I have wanted to become a developer for the past 7 years or so, however I wasn't able to due to my visa restrictions. 

As soon as I became a permanent UK resident (March 2018), I decided to quit my job and have been focusing all my time & energy on becoming a software developer. 

I'm looking to work in an organisation that supports learning and growth where I can make a meaningful contribution. I'm a fast learner, and I'm willing and happy to learn new technologies and skills.

**Tech skills at a glance:** : Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript (ES6), React, Node.js, Express, CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid, Git, HTML
