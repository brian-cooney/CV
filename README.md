I have always enjoyed making and creating things. I am most passionate about working on things that interact with people. I realised this when an app I designed reached 300+ active users. 

I have wanted to become a developer for the past 7+ years, however I wasn't able to due to certain visa restrictions. As soon as I became a permanent UK resident (March 2018), I decided to quit my job & have been focusing all my time & energy on becoming a better software developer. 

I'm looking to work for an organisation that supports learning and growth, where I can make a meaningful contribution. I'm a fast learner, and I'm willing and happy to learn new technologies and skills.

**Tech skills at a glance:** : JavaScript (ES6), React, Node.js, Express, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid, Git, HTML
